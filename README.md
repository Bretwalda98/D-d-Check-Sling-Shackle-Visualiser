# D/d Check – Sling & Shackle Visualiser


This tool helps rigging engineers and lifting planners evaluate sling-to-object **D/d ratios** and apply industry reduction factors.


## Features
- Calculates D/d ratio and basket capacity factor.
- Checks eye length ≥ 2×D.
- Visualises hitch types as CAD-like SVG linework or canvas sketches.
- Sheet mode shows the 5 common cases (eye length, eye→shackle, basket ≥25:1, basket at 2:1, wide-body shackle at 5:1).
- Optional WLL input to calculate adjusted capacity.


## Standards & Guidance
This tool’s rules align with common UK/EU standards and industry references:


- **BS EN 13414‑1:2003 + A2:2008** (Wire rope slings – safety). Basket hitch WLLs assume D/d ≥ 25:1; eye length ≥ 2×D.
- **BS EN 12385‑4** (Steel wire ropes – safety factors, breaking forces).
- **BS 1290:1983** (Wire rope slings for general lifting purposes).
- **Unirope Rigging Guidelines**: Confirms 25:1 baseline, 5:1 minimum for TRI‑FLEX® / GATOR‑FLEX®.
- **KW Ropes Technical Table**: Confirms D/d ≥ 25:1 for full capacity.
- **Certex UK Guidance**: D/d should never be < 1:1, significant reduction at tight bends.


## Disclaimer
This is an engineering **aid** only. Always verify against the lift plan, applicable standards (ASME B30.9, BS/EN), and manufacturer data.
